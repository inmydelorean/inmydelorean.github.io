Well, actually it's not that complicated as I thought it would be. Thanks to codecademy and all other great tutorials of course.

Lets try to add some code snippet as in the example post:

{% highlight ruby %}
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

This should be fine for now))

UPD. Yessss! It works! Just need to save file as .markdown instead of .mdowm

So if I add [this link][link1] here (hint: git guide for dummies) it should work as in first post.
